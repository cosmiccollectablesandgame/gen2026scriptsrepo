### Description
This issue is to track the implementation of header resolver, schema enforcement, and to ensure that all failures are loud to aid in debugging.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement a header resolver that efficiently matches headers to their corresponding data structures.  
2. Introduce schema enforcement to validate headers against predefined schemas.  
3. Ensure that all failures raise exceptions or errors that provide clear and actionable information.
